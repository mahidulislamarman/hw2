<p>As an online course creator, you may be overwhelmed by the seemingly endless list of to-dos. When you’re not spending time developing your course,
    you’re likely writing social media copy, making reels, developing a marketing strategy, or building your email list.</p>

<b>But here’s the thing: you don’t have to do it alone.
</b>

<p>The Thinkific Store on Fiverr gives you the support you need. It allows you to quickly–and easily –find a professional freelancer to help take some tasks off your plate and get back to focusing on what you’re best at: teaching your students. Whether you’re stuck on designing a logo for your new business, setting up your website, or developing a marketing campaign, the Thinkific Store on Fiverr is here to help. 

</p>

<b>What is the Thinkific Store on Fiverr?</b>

<p>The Thinkific Store on Fiverr is a curated marketplace of agencies and freelancers dedicated to helping you build, launch, and market your online course. Plus, with Fiverr’s variety of freelancers, you can stay well within your budget. Not only do you no longer have to break the bank to get the help you need, you speed up the process of launching (and scaling) your online course by outsourcing tasks to those with expertise in that area. 

</p>

<p>“The launch of the Thinkific store on Fiverr gives so many more users access to Thinkific partners who can help them get their courses up and selling in half the time,” says Tameka N. Allen, Allen Digital Group online course consultant and launch manager.

</p>

<p>When we spoke with course creators and freelancers alike, we found out that using the Thinkific Store on Fiverr can help you in three key ways. Here’s how:‍

</p>

<b>1. Using a Fiverr freelancer saves you time
</b>

<p>One thing we all want more of? Time. Using a Fiverr freelancer helps you create more of it.

</p>

<p>Matt Bailey, Founder of SiteLogic, has over 25 years of digital marketing experience. For the past six years, he led onsite training for companies’ marketing departments. “In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to take my training and create online courses,” he says. 

</p>

<p>When the pandemic finally allowed him the time to transfer his knowledge online, he says he tried nearly 15 learning management systems before he landed on Thinkific. “Thinkific did just about everything I wanted,” says Matt.

</p>

<p>Seeking support in creating an email template and drip email campaign, Matt hired two Fiverr freelancers–Reema Singhal from India and Andrew from Italy–to help him. While he already had marketing knowledge and experience, Matt chose to outsource those tasks because he felt that his time was better spent elsewhere. Plus, he hated writing.</p>

<b>2. Using a Fiverr freelancer provides you with a seasoned perspective
</b>

<p>If this is your first rodeo, getting an outsider’s perspective on your business may be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful launch.

</p>

<p>Linda Reed-Enever, a Thinkific Expert, helps Thinkific course creators build, market and sell online courses through her own brand and her services offered through the Thinkific Store on Fiverr.

</p>

<p>On the Thinkific Store on Fiverr, Linda helps creators by doing landing page and course reviews, selling downloadable course planning sheets to help people put their knowledge into action, and offering Q&A sessions where she helps creators develop a course creation strategy.

</p>

<p>She thinks that the biggest benefit of using a Fiverr freelancer is gaining an outsider’s perspective on your content. “Many course creators don’t have previous experience in content creation or marketing,” she explains. “A lot of people come to me who don’t know how to communicate the value of their course or set up their landing pages. It’s a great idea to get advice from people who’ve created courses before.”

</p>

<p>When Matt Bailey’s Fiverr freelancer created his drip email campaign, he also realized the importance of this third-party perspective. He was thrilled by the final product; no revisions were required, and all he had to do was copy and paste the content into the email template. “When Reema looked at my content and created her own, I realized that what was important to her would be important to someone who’s interested in taking my courses,” he says. “I can write about my own stuff, but the person working in the field is whose opinion is important.”

</p>

<b>3. Using a Fiverr freelancer helps you stay focused on your zone of genius
</b>

<p>Perhaps the biggest struggle for creators like you is staying in your own lane. When tasks pile up, you might not have the time to remain focused on the tasks in your business that you love doing–aka your zone of genius.

</p>

<p>Kathey Porter, BusinessFAB® Academy lead instructor, entrepreneur, speaker, author, and small business strategist, had Thinkific Expert Yasaf Burshan set up her marketing automation program so that she could focus her time and energy on her zone of genius: course creation. 

</p>

<p>As a course creator, she believes that the most important part of the job is creating compelling content. Working with Yasaf allows her the time to do so. “I don't have the luxury of a big team in which to delegate,” she says. “But, as a CEO, I know it's important that I stay focused working on the business rather than getting bogged down with every aspect of every task. Thinkific provides a resource that allows me to get the exact support that I need from providers that know the course content industry.”

</p>

<p>In Kathey’s case, outsourcing her work helped to give her time to focus on content development and refining her marketing strategy. For those who want to focus their time on creating content, she recommends that they leverage Fiverr freelancers through Thinkific. “Early on, I made mistakes and spent money on things that I didn't need and that didn't really help move the needle with my course,” she continues. “Outsourcing gives me those five extra sets of hands to get stuff done and meet my timelines.”

</p>

<b>Advice for outsourcing work
</b>

<p>When it comes to outsourcing your work, these freelancers and course creators have a few pieces of advice.

</p>

<p>Linda Reed-Enever recommends that Thinkific customers do their research before hiring a Fiverr freelancer. Since you’re not conducting interviews before hiring, it’s important to read each review thoroughly.

</p>

<p>She also says it’s important to be clear about what you’re looking for and have realistic expectations; if you’re hiring someone for a landing page review, don’t expect a full consultation and other add-ons that weren’t part of the initial brief. “Be prepared that you might have to hire a couple of people to find the right fit,” she advises.

</p>

<p>Julien Truffaut says he described his project to 5-6 people on Fiverr, went through each freelancer’s portfolio, and hired a couple of people before he found the right person. “I would recommend outsourcing a small task and hiring two or three people to do it until you find the right person,” he explains.
